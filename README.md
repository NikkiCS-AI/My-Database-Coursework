# My-Database-Coursework

A simple CRM system built with PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript — designed to run locally using MAMP.  

## 🚀 Project Purpose  

This project provides a basic Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool to manage customers, leads, interactions, reminders, and track sales. It was created as a database coursework project to demonstrate relational database design and full-stack web development using PHP and MySQL.

## 📦 Tech Stack & Prerequisites  

- **Backend:** PHP  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Local development environment:** [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/) (or any similar Apache + MySQL setup)

## ✅ Features  

- User login / authentication  
- Add, view, update, and delete customer records  
- Manage leads, interactions, and reminders  
- Sales dashboard / admin panel to overview data  
- CRUD operations for all data entities via web interface  

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikkiCS-AI/My-Database-Coursework.git
2. Start MAMP and ensure Apache + MySQL are running.

3. Create a new MySQL database — for example: crm_db.

4. Import the SQL schema:

- Open the file COMP1044_Database.sql from the repo and run it (via phpMyAdmin or MySQL CLI) to create the necessary tables.

5. Copy the project folder into your MAMP htdocs (or your web root directory).

6. If required, update the database connection settings in the PHP configuration to match your MySQL credentials (username, password, database name).

7. Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost/[your-project-folder]/

## 🧭 Usage

* Perform CRUD operations (Create / Read / Update / Delete) on customer, lead, interaction records via the web interface.
 

## 🎯 What I Learned & Motivation

* Design a relational database schema that handles customers, leads, interactions, and reminders

* Implement CRUD operations using PHP & MySQL

* Build a full-stack web app with HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end and PHP back-end
